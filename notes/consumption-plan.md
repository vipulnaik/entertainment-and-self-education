# Consumption plan

Last major update: October 6, 2022.

## Current plan

* After the HBO subscription finishes on October 7, spend a few weeks
  focused on VikiPass Standard consumption as well as catching up on
  Freevee and other things.
* Start Netflix around mid-November or later.
* Continue with Netflix and VikiPass Standard for a few months.
* Maybe in 2023, switch for a while to Amazon Prime Video, PBS
  documentaries, Disney+, and HBO in turns.

I might end up starting Netflix earlier than planned.

## HBO

Some stuff I plan to consume when I resume my HBO subscription:

* Gone with the Wind
* 2001: A Space Odyssey
* Many other documentaries
* House of the Dragon (it's airing right now and won't finish before I
  leave; I prefer to start watching when the whole season is
  available)
* More seasons of: The Wire, Westworld, Veep, The Big Bang Theory
* The Sopranos -- maybe finish Season 1
* The West Wing (maybe)

## PBS documentaries through Amazon

At $3.99, this is relatively cheap so I might pick this up some time
when I'm in the mood to watch documentaries. My intent is to subscribe
for a stretch of between 1 and 3 months.

Some of the documentaries that I might be interested in:

* Civil War by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick
* The War by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick
* The Roosevelts - An Intimate History by Ken Burns
* Woodstock: Three Days that Defined a Generation by Barak Goodman
* American Experience: Clinton
* American Experience: The Chinese Exclusion Act
* Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies

## Amazon Prime Video

At $8.99, it's a little cheaper than Netflix, but has poor selection
outside of English language stuff and Bollywood movies.

Blockers to resuming: I want The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Season 5 to be
released before I resume subscription.

Some stuff I hope to consume:

* The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel
* Gully Boy
* Mujhse Dosti Karoge
* Jalsa
* The Rings of Power

## Disney+

I have to figure out whether I want the bundle along with Hulu, or
just Disney+.

Stuff I might want to watch:

* The Handmaid's Tale (Hulu or Disney+ bundle)
* Star Wars (Disney+)
* Simpsons (Hulu or Disney+ bundle)

## Netflix

There's a lot I want to watch on Netflix.

Stuff that is not yet on Netflix, that I expect will get on it in the next several months:

* The Crown Season 5 (ETA: November 2022)
* Ginny & Georgia Season 2 (ETA: November 2022 to January 2023)
* Bridgerton Season 3 (probably mid-late 2023)
* Squid Game Season 2 (probably mid-late 2023)

All the above are Netflix originals so they won't leave once they are
on Netflix.

Stuff that is ready for me to watch:

* Inventing Anna
* Breaking Bad
* Stranger Things
* The Manifest
* Hospital Playlist
* Extraordinary Attorney Woo
* It's Okay to not be Okay
* Hometown Cha Cha Cha
* Romance is Bonus Book
* The Rational Life

(probably a lot more)

## Viki

I currently have a Viki Pass Standard. I have been prioritizing HBO
consumption over Viki consumption but might spend a few weeks in
between my HBO subscription ending and resuming Netflix, in order to
catch up more with it.

VikiPass Standard (or Free):

* Reply 1988 (in progress; also available on Netflix, but I'll
  probably watch this on Viki when I don't have a Netflix subscription
  active)
* The Untamed (just started; also available on Netflix, but I'll
  probably watch this on Viki when I don't have a Netflix subscription
  active)
* The Red Sleeve
* Semantic Error
* Boys over Flowers
* Jirisan
* Strong Woman Do Bong Soon

VikiPass Plus:

* My Love from the Star
* Penthouse

## Freevee

This doesn't need a subscription, so it's ideal to watch in periods in
between subscriptions (e.g., after letting my Netflix subscription
expire but before restarting my HBO subscription).

* ~~Gone Girl (already started, need to finish)~~ no longer on Freevee
* 1917
* Hara-kiri: Death of a Samurai (2012 version is available on Freevee)

Check what's on Freevee (it might change over time).
