## Freevee

This doesn't need a subscription, so it's ideal to watch in periods in
between subscriptions (e.g., after letting my Netflix subscription
expire but before restarting my HBO subscription).

* Hara-kiri: Death of a Samurai (2012 version is available on Freevee)

Check what's on Freevee (it might change over time).
