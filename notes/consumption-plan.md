# Consumption plan

Last major update: September 29, 2023

## Current plan

* After Disney Plus ends with end of September, take a break from paid
  subscriptions other than Viki for a few weeks.

## HBO

Some stuff I plan to consume when I resume my HBO subscription:

* House of the Dragon
* More seasons of: The Wire, Westworld, Veep, The Big Bang Theory
* The Sopranos -- maybe finish Season 1
* The West Wing (maybe)

## PBS documentaries through Amazon

when I'm in the mood to watch documentaries. My intent is to subscribe

starting to watch.
