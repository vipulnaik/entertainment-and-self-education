I was interested in how Pink''s advice would agree and disagree with the advice from Chris Voss on negotiation. I generally liked it; I was impressed at the general level of agreement, with probably the only point of disagreement being the "Five Whys" technique.'),

Alicia Keys, who is also a singer but also a songwriter and composer, seemed like good for my next MasterClass. I enjoyed this MasterClass; the subject matter was more interesting to me than Christina Aguilera''s. I also enjoyed discovering two of her songs that she talked about in her MasterClass: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urdlvw0SSEc (Fallin'') and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rywUS-ohqeE (No One).'),

I started watching it; my interest was also buoyed by the fact that the teacher was featured in https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_meditation that I had paid for a while back. I quite enjoyed it and grasped many more of the basics of meditation than I previously know, but I continue to consider meditation poor bang-for-the-buck for addressing emotional issues and achieving mental clarity. But I see that it is probably helpful once the "low-hanging fruit" have been addressed and one wants to continue to attain higher and higher levels of equanimity and tolerance for the vicissitudes of life. I skipped most of the lesson on the body scan.'),

I found it quite good. Though the overall level of the exercises seems too advanced for me to immediately pursue, I learned and reinforced soem key paradigms around wellness, stress, and recovery.'),

I found it quite decent, but in general I''m finding fairly common themes across MasterClasses so some parts felt repetitive with other MasterClasses (not the fault of Usher!). There was also less by way of technical detail than some other MasterClasses had.'),
  ('MasterClass','Series (such as TV show or web series)',false,'English','Aaron Sorkin Teaches Screenwriting','https://www.masterclass.com/classes/aaron-sorkin-teaches-screenwriting','2021-06-28','day','2021-07-12','day','I watched this after being intrigued by some of Aaron Sorkin''s work, despite considering it off-point in many ways, including The Social Network and Trial of the Chicago 7. I was also interested in comparing and contrasting Sorkin''s guidance with that of Shonda Rhimes, whose MasterClass I had watched a while back. I found his MasterClass quite interesting; particularly the workshop sessions including script readings, pitch sessions, and the West Wing writers'' room. I might write more about this later.'),
  ('MasterClass','Series (such as TV show or web series)',false,'English','St. Vincent Teaches Creativity and Songwriting','https://www.masterclass.com/classes/st-vincent-teaches-creativity-and-songwriting','2021-07-10','day','2021-07-28','day','I watched this MasterClass based on my general interest in music. I had not heard of St. Vincent or heard her songs before. Many themes repeated what I had already gathered from watching other music MasterClasses, but I did enjoy it quite a bit (more than Usher, that was also somewhat repetitive of previous MasterClasses). It was interesting to see the ''making of'' her song Savior, which I also liked after listening to it a few times.'),

It was reasonably interesting, and a good contrast to the screenwriting MasterClass from Aaron Sorkin and the related MasterClass from Shonda Rhimes.'),
  ('MasterClass','Series (such as TV show or web series)',false,'English','deadmau5 Teaches Electronic Music Production','https://www.masterclass.com/classes/deadmau5-teaches-electronic-music-production','2021-08-06','day','2021-08-23','day','I watched this MasterClass as part of my general interest in music, and specifically in electronic music editing (though I am not specifically interested in EDM). I had a chance to refresh my stems of knowledge about many topics related to music editing, as well as plant seeds for things I hope to learn in more detail in the future. Overall, I found it quite interesting! deadmau5 is quite opinionated, but seemed good about separating his personal takes from general factual knowledge.'),

While there was quite an overlap with other music MasterClasses I had watched, the instructor''s greater age and therefore exposure to different historical periods lent different dimensions to this MasterClass. Overall, I found it worth the watch.'),

I found it generally interesting and engaging, though of limited applicability to me. I had previously watched Amy Tan''s fiction-writing MasterClass so it was interesting to compare the two.'),
  ('MasterClass','Series (such as TV show or web series)',false,'English','Itzhak Perlman Teaches Violin','https://www.masterclass.com/classes/itzhak-perlman-teaches-violin','2021-11-07','day','2021-11-16','day','I watched this MasterClass given my general interest in music, but my initial expectations were low as to how valuable it would be; I''m more interested in music composition than in playing instruments. However, I found the class to be unexpectedly useful in getting me to think more about various techniques used in playing musical instruments (such as legato, spiccato, vibrato, tremolo, etc.). The violin may be particularly suited for this given the many dimensions (degrees of freedom) involved, but I don''t know enough to judge. I found it interesting enough that I plan to consume the available MasterClasses on other instruments before my subscription runs out.'),
  ('MasterClass','Series (such as TV show or web series)',false,'English','Carlos Santana Teaches the Art and Soul of Guitar','https://www.masterclass.com/classes/carlos-santana-teaches-the-art-and-soul-of-guitar','2021-11-16','day','2021-12-06','day','I watched this MasterClass right after Itzhak Perlman''s violin MasterClass; since that one had exceeded my expectations, I was interested in other MasterClasses about instruments. The two MasterClasses contrasted quite a bit; while Perlman was focused a lot more on technique and precision, Santana''s was more about how the music makes you feel. This probably reflects a bunch of differences: the kind of instruments they play (violins are more technically challenging), their roles (Perlman seems strictly an instrumentalist and Santana is more of a composer and freestyler), and their personalities. Overall I found Perlman''s more useful, but I appreciated both and felt the order of consumption was the right one.'),

I had already previously watched the Chris Voss MasterClass (see https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CRAzG386t3suSqDgd/chris-voss-negotiation-masterclass-review for my lengthy review) and was interested to see how the session version differed. The session version was somewhat longer, and in most cases went into more detail on the techniques; it also covered a few additional techniques such as paraphrasing and summaries. It had many more demonstration videos that on the whole added a lot of value.');
