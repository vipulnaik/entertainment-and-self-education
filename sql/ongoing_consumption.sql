  ('Series (such as TV show or web series)','English','Gilmore Girls','https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B002DEI4NG/','Starting around 2020 or 2021, I''ve been rewatching Gilmore Girls (seasons 1 through 7, as well as A Year in the life) off and on. I have done both systematic start-to-end rewatches and random watching of specific episodes that I like. I find Gilmore Girls relaxing to watch. I usually don''t watch it during meals, but often watch it when doing somewhat boring and not-fully-engaging work, to provide a little additional stimulation without being distracting (because I know the storyline very well). I own all seasons but not A Year in the Life. So I can watch anything from seasons 1 through 7 whenever I wish, but for A Year in the Life I can only watch it when I''m subscribed to Netflix.'),

Veritasium provides good intellectual stimulation and I also learn some useful stuff from it. I originally started watching Veritasium in the early 2010s, but then didn''t watch it for several years. I resumed watching Veritasium videos in 2022. I don''t record each individual video viewed, since I watch so many and they are not individually that noteworthy.'),
